As tomatoes start to open and turn jammy, squish them so they turn saucy. At this point, add chili flakes and continue to cook until broken down into a sauce. Make your toast. While your tomatoes cook, either toast or grill your bread. To grill, heat a good glug olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add bread and grill until golden on both sides and sprinkle with salt. Once bread is toasted or grilled, take a peeled garlic clove and rub it across the bread. Finish your shakshuka. Once tomatoes are cooked, add dollops of cottage cheese throughout your pan. Make little pockets in your tomatoes with a spoon and crack eggs in, cover and cook for 3-6 minutes (4 for soft yolk, 6 for hard). Remove from heat, remove lid and sprinkle with EBTB seasoning or sesame seeds, salt, and fresh herbs. Serve with toast.",

    "instructions": "Bring a large pot of well-seasoned water to a boil for the pasta. Slice the zucchinis into rounds about as thick as your little finger, cutting any large zucchinis in half lengthwise first. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot and add the zucchinis. Season well with salt to draw out the moisture and fry for 5 minutes to get things going, before adding the garlic and red pepper flakes. The key here is to end up with zucchinis that are softened but not mushy, some beginning to collapse while others still have a bit of bite. Keep stirring the zucchinis, and meanwhile get the pasta in. When the pasta is al dente, remove a large mug of starchy water from the pot before straining. Add the pasta to the zucchinis, grate in the lemon zest, then add the mascarpone and a generous splash of the reserved pasta water. Mix vigorously until the sauce is well combined and coats the pasta, adding more pasta water and mascarpone as needed. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, then add the basil and butter. Mix again and taste to check your seasoning. Serve immediately with a drizzle of really good olive oil.",

      "Kosher salt",
      "1 cup all-purpose flour",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 cups panko bread crumbs, pulsed in a blender until fine",

      "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill",
      "1 tablespoon capers, drained and finely chopped",
      "1 tablespoon finely chopped pickle",

      "Butter lettuce leaves",
      "1 radish, very thinly sliced"
    ],
    "instructions": "Prepare the chicken schnitzel: Place the butterflied chicken breasts between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap and use a rolling pin or skillet to pound them out until each is ¼ inch thick. Then cut each cutlet in half.\n\nSet up a breading station: In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt. Place the flour in a second shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. In a third, mix together the panko, sesame seeds, and salt and pepper to taste. Working with one piece at a time, place the chicken cutlets in the flour, dust off any excess, then dredge through the beaten egg. Let any excess drip off before placing the chicken in the panko-sesame mixture. Gently press the panko onto the chicken to ensure it's well coated. Transfer to a plate.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat about ½ inch grapeseed oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add 2 or 3 pieces of chicken (as many as you can fit without overcrowding the pan) and fry until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a wire cooling rack, immediately seasoning it with salt. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces as necessary.\n\nMake the tartar slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together the mayo, dill, capers, pickle, mustard, lemon juice, vinegar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Taste for seasoning and adjust as desired. Add the cabbage and massage the sauce in with your hands, ensuring the cabbage is totally coated and beginning to soften.\n\nTo assemble: In a small bowl, mix together the harissa and honey. On each bun, build a sandwich with a leaf of butter lettuce, 2 pieces of the crispy chicken schnitzel, a drizzle of harissa honey, a scoop of the tartar slaw, and a few slices of radish.",

Remove the pot from the heat and let the soup steep, off the heat, for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the chicken and let it cool slightly. Pick the meat off the chicken carcass and tear into bite-size pieces (or use two forks to shred it). Discard the skin and bones along with the herbs. Return the chicken meat to the broth and serve warm, or let the soup cool completely before dividing it among storage containers and storing in the fridge for up to 1 week (it's even better the next day) or in the freezer for up to 1 month.",
