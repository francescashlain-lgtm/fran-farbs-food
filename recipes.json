As tomatoes start to open and turn jammy, squish them so they turn saucy. At this point, add chili flakes and continue to cook until broken down into a sauce. Make your toast. While your tomatoes cook, either toast or grill your bread. To grill, heat a good glug olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add bread and grill until golden on both sides and sprinkle with salt. Once bread is toasted or grilled, take a peeled garlic clove and rub it across the bread. Finish your shakshuka. Once tomatoes are cooked, add dollops of cottage cheese throughout your pan. Make little pockets in your tomatoes with a spoon and crack eggs in, cover and cook for 3-6 minutes (4 for soft yolk, 6 for hard). Remove from heat, remove lid and sprinkle with EBTB seasoning or sesame seeds, salt, and fresh herbs. Serve with toast.",

Slice the zucchinis into rounds about as thick as your little finger, cutting any large zucchinis in half lengthwise first. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot and add the zucchinis. Season well with salt to draw out the moisture and fry for 5 minutes to get things going, before adding the garlic and red pepper flakes. The key here is to end up with zucchinis that are softened but not mushy, some beginning to collapse while others still have a bit of bite. Keep stirring the zucchinis, and meanwhile get the pasta in. When the pasta is al dente, remove a large mug of starchy water from the pot before straining. Add the pasta to the zucchinis, grate in the lemon zest, then add the mascarpone and a generous splash of the reserved pasta water. Mix vigorously until the sauce is well combined and coats the pasta, adding more pasta water and mascarpone as needed. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, then add the basil and butter. Mix again and taste to check your seasoning. Serve immediately with a drizzle of really good olive oil.",

In a third, mix together the panko, sesame seeds, and salt and pepper to taste. Working with one piece at a time, place the chicken cutlets in the flour, dust off any excess, then dredge through the beaten egg. Let any excess drip off before placing the chicken in the panko-sesame mixture. Gently press the panko onto the chicken to ensure it's well coated. Transfer to a plate.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat about \u00bd inch grapeseed oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add 2 or 3 pieces of chicken (as many as you can fit without overcrowding the pan) and fry until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a wire cooling rack, immediately seasoning it with salt. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces as necessary.\n\nMake the tartar slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together the mayo, dill, capers, pickle, mustard, lemon juice, vinegar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Taste for seasoning and adjust as desired. Add the cabbage and massage the sauce in with your hands, ensuring the cabbage is totally coated and beginning to soften.\n\nTo assemble: In a small bowl, mix together the harissa and honey. On each bun, build a sandwich with a leaf of butter lettuce, 2 pieces of the crispy chicken schnitzel, a drizzle of harissa honey, a scoop of the tartar slaw, and a few slices of radish.",

Store in a sealed container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days or freeze and use within 3 months.\n\nWhen you're ready to cook the steak, you can grill, broil, or pan-sear it to your liking. To broil: Preheat the broiler and move the oven rack to the highest level. Place the steak on a broiler pan or baking sheet and broil on each side for about 5 minutes for medium to medium-well. The internal temp should read 155\u00b0F for medium steak.\n\nAllow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.

Pinch the edges of the crust against the pie dish to keep it in place. Brush the crust with the beaten egg. Use a paring knife to cut a few slits in the crust so that steam can escape. Sprinkle the crust with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper.\n\nPlace the pie on a sheet pan and bake until the crust is browned and the filling is bubbling, about 50 minutes. Serve hot.\n\nTo make ahead: Assemble the pie up to a couple of days in advance and bake just before serving. It also freezes well - freeze unbaked and bake from frozen (about an hour).",

    "instructions": "Equipment: Bring out your stand mixer with the dough hook.\n\nMake the Babka Dough: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once foamy, stir often, until the foam subsides, 4 to 5 minutes. The butter should be nice and golden and smelling nutty. If you see the butter getting too dark, then remove it from the heat. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.\n\nIn the same pot off the heat, add the milk and let it warm until it reaches 110°F. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Add your yeast, give it a stir, and let sit for about 5 minutes, until your yeast is foamy and bubbly. If you don't see any foaming or small bubbles forming, repeat this step with new yeast and milk to ensure your yeast is still alive!\n\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine your flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Using a spatula or spoon, give this a toss until combined.\n\nSwirl the brown butter around the bowl (this is to grease the sides of the bowl, which you'll use later) and pour the butter into the stand mixer. Add the milk/yeast mixture and the whole eggs plus the yolk, turn the mixer on low to combine for a minute, and then to medium to mix until the dough has formed. If the dough is really sticky and wet, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough is one complete mixture. It's okay if it's a tad tacky, but it should all be combined.\n\nAdd your babka dough to the buttered bowl, tossing to coat on all sides with the butter, and shape into a rough ball. Cover tightly and let sit until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or 8 to 12 hours in the fridge.\n\nMake your Brown Butter & Miso Cinnamon Filling: In a small saucepan, brown your butter using the same method as before. While the butter is melting, use a little of it to brush all sides of two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans. Once the butter is browned, remove from the heat, and add your brown sugar, miso, cinnamon, and vanilla. Mix well until combined and cool for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. As it sits it will firm up and turn into a thick, spreadable paste.\n\nRoll and bake: Line the pans with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over the long sides so that the baked loaves are easier to remove. Punch down the dough with your fist. Flour a pastry slab or other work surface and transfer your dough to it. Divide into 2 equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface into a 24 by 8-inch rectangle. Dividing the filling evenly, spread it along all sides and inside of each dough rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the sides of the dough.\n\nStarting on a short side, tightly roll each piece of dough into a thick log. Pinch the ends together to seal. Transfer both logs to a large sheet pan and place in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up.\n\nRemove from the freezer and set on the work surface. With a serrated knife, trim about 1/2 inch off the ends of each log. Slice each log in half lengthwise and then form a braid by making an X in the middle with the two log halves, filling-side up. Fold over from the center on both sides, wrapping the log halves around each other as tight as you can, pinching at the ends to keep in place. Like an accordion, push both ends of the babka to shorten it up (so it fits in the pan) and transfer to a prepared loaf pan.\n\nCover tightly and let sit at room temperature until the dough rises slightly and fills out the pans, 2 to 3 hours.\n\nPreheat your oven to 350°F.\n\nTransfer to the oven and bake until your babkas turn a nice golden brown, without getting too dark, 35 to 45 minutes. To test doneness, you can use a thermometer; it should read 185° to 210°F.\n\nRemove from the oven and brush simple syrup over your babkas. Let them cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Then transfer to a cutting board and let sit for 5 to 10 more minutes before slicing. Serve warm!",

    "instructions": "Cook the lentils: Bring a medium saucepan filled with 2 quarts water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil. Add the lentils, give them a good stir, and return the water to a simmer, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer while they cook. Simmer until they are cooked through and no longer toothsome but not mushy, 15 to 35 minutes, depending on what type of lentils you have and how old they are. Taste them periodically to evaluate their doneness before draining them. Drain the lentils in a fine-mesh strainer and let them cool in the strainer while you prepare the walnut dressing. Reserve the saucepan.\n\nMake the spiced walnut oil: Coarsely chop the walnuts. In the reserved saucepan, combine the olive oil and the chopped walnuts and cook over medium-low heat, swirling the pan often so that they cook evenly, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Keep an eye on them, as they can turn from toasty to burnt pretty quickly. Remove from the heat. Add the cumin seeds and ground coriander and stir to combine. Using a Microplane, immediately grate the garlic cloves into the still-hot oil; stir to combine. The residual heat from the oil will toast the spices and mellow out the garlic, removing its raw bite. Stir in the golden raisins, red wine vinegar, and 1 teaspoon salt.\n\nDress the lentils: Add the drained lentils back to the medium saucepan with the walnut mixture and gently stir everything to combine. Thinly slice the feta into large 1/4-inch-thick planks. Tear the basil leaves in half, or into small pieces if large, and toss them through the lentils. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Divide the lentils among 4 serving bowls. Top each with a few feta planks and black pepper and drizzle with more olive oil.",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400°F.\n\nChop the onions. Finely chop enough ginger to measure 1/4 cup (no need to peel). Finely chop the garlic. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 heaping cups). Drain and rinse the lentils.\n\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add several generous glugs of olive oil and the chopped onions and ginger and season generously with kosher salt and pepper. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic. Stir until fragrant and softened but not browned, about 1 minute.\n\nPush the aromatics to one side and add another glug of olive oil to the empty spot. To the oil, add the curry powder, turmeric, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Cook in the oil until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir the spices into the aromatics and continue cooking for another minute.\n\nStir in 2/3 cup cold water. Add the lentils, sweet potatoes, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat as needed to maintain a brisk simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the sweet potatoes are just barely tender, 7 to 9 minutes.\n\nPlace the thawed spinach in a kitchen towel and squeeze firmly to expel as much water as possible. Add the spinach and stir to distribute and warm through. Adjust the seasoning with kosher salt, pepper, and/or red pepper flakes. Transfer the filling to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n\nIf your puff pastry comes in 2 sheets, on a lightly floured surface, unfurl one sheet, brush it lightly with melted butter, and place the second right on top. Roll the sheets to about 10x14 inches. Lay the puff pastry on top of the filling. Press down on the pastry to allow it to slump into the dish and adhere to the inside edges, then gently fold the corners to crease and make a seal.\n\nIn a small dish, beat the egg. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the top of the pastry with the egg wash. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and pepper. With a knife, cut a series of vent slits in the top of the pastry. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temp to 350°F and continue baking until the pastry is puffed and deeply golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.",

Set half of the sliced onions aside.

Using your hands, work the sausage together until it forms 2 homogeneous ball-shaped masses. Place the 2 sausage balls on half of a large piece of parchment paper, fold the parchment over them, and firmly smash down on each ball with the bottom of a heavy skillet to flatten them into 4-inch-ish rounds.\n\nToast the English muffins: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Lightly spread both sides of the English muffins with some of the mayo-hot sauce mixture. Arrange them cut-side down in the skillet and toast, moving them around the skillet as needed, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\n\nCook the patties: Raise the heat to high and add a big glug of vegetable oil to the skillet. Heat until you see wisps of smoke. Remove the parchment from one side of the patties and then flop the patties, one at a time, into the skillet. Peel the parchment back. Divide the raw sliced onions between them, topping each patty. Season the onions well with salt. Cook, undisturbed, until the patties are well caramelized underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the patties. Turn off the heat and place a slice of American cheese on each patty. Cover the skillet with a lid to allow the cheese to melt and the onions to cook from the residual heat.\n\nCook the eggs: Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once the foaming subsides, add the beaten eggs. Working quickly with a heatproof rubber spatula, pull the eggs from the outside edges of the pan toward the center, tilting the pan to allow any raw egg to run toward the outside and continuing to push the eggs toward the center, until large fluffy curds have set in the center but are still slightly wet on top, 30 seconds. Remove from the heat.\n\nAssemble: Slather more spicy mayo on the cut sides of the English muffins. Place a sausage patty on the bottom halves of the muffins. Divide the scrambled eggs between them. Add more hot sauce, if desired. Top with some of the pickled onions, a small handful of arugula, and the top halves of the muffins. EAT!",

Place in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring the pot every minute or so, until the butter has turned very foamy and bubbling but not yet browned, about 6 minutes.\n\nQuickly add the finely ground pistachios and cook, stirring constantly, until they smell very nutty and are golden brown and the butter has browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. The nuts should no longer be bright green and the butter around them should be deeply speckled with brown.\n\nUsing a rubber spatula, scrape the brown butter mixture into a large bowl. Add 1 ice cube to the butter and let the ice cube melt and the butter cool for 10 minutes.\n\nMake the cookie dough: Chop the dark chocolate into irregular 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch chunks.\n\nTo the cooled butter, add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk vigorously until well combined and thickened, about 1 minute.\n\nAdd the flour, kosher salt, and baking soda, and stir well with a spatula or wooden spoon until combined and a sticky dough forms.\n\nAdd half of the chopped chocolate along with 2 ounces halva, crumbling it lightly with your fingers as you add it.

Cook until they begin to sizzle and fry in the fat and stick to the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nAdd the red and white wines, scraping to release anything from the bottom of the pot, then reduce the heat to medium.\n\nCrumble the meat into smaller pieces as you add it back into the pot. Cook, mashing and stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has cooked off and the pot is mostly dry, 9 to 11 minutes.\n\nStir in 2 1/2 cups water.

Remove from the oven and combine all of the cabbage on one baking sheet, reserving the other pan for the meatballs.\n\nIncrease the oven temperature to 500°F.\n\nMeanwhile, make the meatballs: In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg. Add the panko, 2 tablespoons tahini, cumin, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil and whisk to combine. Finely grate 2 garlic cloves into the panko mixture. Chop 1/2 cup mint leaves and add them to the mixture along with about 1/3 pound ground lamb.

Finely grate the remaining garlic clove into the tahini. Whisk the sauce to combine. It should have a pourable consistency; if it looks too thick, whisk in another splash of water.\n\nAssemble and serve: Spread some of the tahini sauce on each plate, and top with the cabbage, meatballs, and the remaining 1/2 cup mint leaves.",

    ],
    "instructions": "Prep the rice: Place the basmati rice in a medium bowl and cover with room-temperature water. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes.\n\nCrisp up the chicken: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels to remove any surface moisture; this will encourage crispiness and browning. Season the chicken thighs all over with 2 teaspoons salt and a few good cranks of black pepper.\n\nArrange the thighs skin-side down in a large, dry Dutch oven. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, undisturbed, until the skin releases easily from the pot and is light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nOnce the chicken skin no longer sticks to the pot, move the chicken thighs around a bit in the pot to ensure even browning and continue to cook until the skin is very crisp and deeply golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes longer. When the chicken skin is very crispy, use tongs to transfer the thighs to a plate, skin-side up.\n\nWhile the chicken cooks, do some prep: Finely chop the onion. Finely chop 6 garlic cloves.\n\nDrain the rice: Drain the soaked rice in a fine-mesh strainer, rinsing with cold water and swirling the rice around with your fingers until the water runs completely clear, 1 to 2 minutes. Set the strainer on top of a kitchen towel to drain any additional water.\n\nAdd the aromatics and toast the rice: Reduce the heat under the Dutch oven to medium-low and stir in the chopped onion. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent and soft, about 6 minutes. Add the chopped garlic to the pot and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Season with salt and lots of black pepper.\n\nStir in the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains turn translucent around the edges, 1 minute. We are toasting the rice to coat it in all of that schmaltzy flavor.\n\nAdd 2 cups water, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1 teaspoon salt and stir to scrape up any bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the water boils, nestle the chicken thighs back into the pot, skin-side up, along with any accumulated juices. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook without removing the lid (we don't want any of that steam to escape!) for exactly 16 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat. Let the rice finish steaming, covered, for 10 minutes.\n\nMake the lemony yogurt: Finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and 1 garlic clove into a small bowl. Stir in 1 cup whole-milk yogurt. Cut the lemon in half. Squeeze in the juice of the lemon halves. Season the yogurt with salt.\n\nChop some stuff: Cut 4 ounces snap peas crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Coarsely chop 3/4 cup roasted, salted pistachios. Finely chop the leaves and tender stems from 1 large bunch of dill, discarding the tough stems. You should have about 1 cup chopped. Yep, that's a ton of dill. Cut a lemon in half.\n\nFluff and finish: Transfer the chicken to a plate. Fluff the rice with a fork. Add the snap peas, chopped dill, pistachios, and the juice of the halved lemon, fluffing with a fork as you incorporate them all. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Divide the rice and chicken among shallow serving bowls or plates. Spoon some of the lemony yogurt over top and finish with a few cranks of black pepper.",

      "4 romaine hearts"
    ],
    "instructions": "Make the croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Tear half of a baguette into irregular 1-inch pieces; you should end up with about 3 cups of torn bread. Toss on a rimmed baking sheet with the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and a few good cranks of black pepper until well coated. Bake until deeply golden brown and crisp, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool.\n\nMake the dressing: Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs. Place the yolks in a large bowl (where you'll build your dressing) and reserve the whites for another use.\n\nFinely grate the garlic clove and the zest of about half of the lemon into the large bowl. Squeeze in the juice of half of the lemon.\n\nFinely chop the anchovies, then mash them to a paste using the side of a chef's knife until homogeneous; add to the large bowl.\n\nAdd the Dijon mustard and whisk everything to combine. Place a damp kitchen towel underneath the bowl to stabilize it.\n\nStarting with a very thin stream at first, whisking constantly as you go, incorporate the canola oil into the yolk mixture until it is thick, creamy, and pale yellow.\n\nWhisk in 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, the Worcestershire sauce, and 1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup). Taste the dressing on a leaf of romaine—it should be salty, cheesy, and lemony. Make any adjustments necessary.\n\nPrep the lettuce: Tear the leaves of the romaine hearts into 2-inch pieces and transfer them to the bowl of dressing. Squeeze the juice of half of the lemon over the romaine, season with salt, and toss the leaves to coat.\n\nServe: Add the croutons and gently toss the lettuce with your hands until well coated. Add 1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) and toss again. Divide among plates and top with more grated Parmesan and black pepper.",

Let cool.\n\nMix your dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and kosher salt.\n\nCombine your wet ingredients: Peel 4 ripe bananas, break them into thirds, and place in a large bowl. Using a fork or potato masher, mash the bananas until they are a very thick, mostly homogeneous pulp.\n\nWhisk in the labneh, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla until the mixture is homogeneous, about 1 minute.\n\nWhisk the cooled butter into the wet ingredients, using a spatula to scrape any bits that are stuck to the pan—those contain all the flavor.\n\nCombine and bake: Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. There may be a few floury patches remaining, but the batter should be mostly mixed.\n\nScrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, evening it out with the back of a spoon or a spatula.

Cook, stirring, until the onion is a deep golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly, then add to the bowl with the chicken, along with the panko, egg, milk or water, 1 teaspoon salt, and many grinds of black pepper. Stir to combine evenly (I use a fork).\n\nScoop up about 2 tablespoons of the meatball mixture at a time, and then roll back and forth briefly in your wet palms to form a smoother spherical shape. Arrange on a plate. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture.\n\nAdd the remaining butter and oil to your frying pan over medium heat. Arrange the meatballs in one layer. They will seem very soft and you'll worry that this isn't going to work, but as soon as they've cooked for a couple minutes they will begin to hold together better. Don't move them until they're browned underneath, then nudge and roll them around the pan until they're as evenly brown all over as possible. Remove the meatballs with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels.\n\nMake the sauce: Pour in the Marsala, and simmer until it's almost completely cooked off, scraping up any browned bits that have stuck to the pan. Add the butter to the pan and let it melt, then whisk in the flour; cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Slowly add the broth, whisking the whole time. Add the cream, and bring the mixture to a simmer, then add salt and pepper to taste. Return the meatballs to the pan, turn to coat them in the sauce, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover; let them simmer in the sauce for 10 minutes. Check a meatball; they should be cooked through, but if not, give them a couple more minutes.\n\nCook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook the noodles according to package directions (6 to 8 minutes is usually right). Drain.\n\nTo finish: Place the noodles in a bowl and toss with butter. Add meatballs and pan gravy on top. Garnish with chives.",

Season with more fish sauce or salt, if needed.\n\nWhile the Chicken Simmers, Make the Crispy Skin: Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and a wire rack. Pat the chicken skin dry with a paper towel and lay it on the prepared sheet pan. Bake until golden and crispy, flipping halfway through, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.\n\nServe: Fill each bowl with noodles and top with the chicken (shredded or whole, up to you). Ladle over the broth and finish with the pickled shallots, cilantro, and crispy chicken skin. Serve with lime wedges.",

Drizzle with enough olive oil to coat and season with garlic powder and a pinch of kosher salt. Spread the broccoli in an even layer over another sheet pan, leaving one-quarter of the tray empty. Roast for 15 minutes.\n\nRoast the Pistachios: Meanwhile, add the pistachios to the same bowl used for the broccoli and toss with the fennel pollen, pepper flakes, a pinch of kosher salt, and enough olive oil to coat. Add the pistachios to the empty section of sheet pan and return it to the oven. Bake until the nuts have toasted and the broccoli is tender and beginning to char in places, about 5 minutes more.\n\nMake the Salad: Combine the farro, broccoli, pistachios, arugula, and tomatoes in a large bowl.
