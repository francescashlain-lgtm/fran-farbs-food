As tomatoes start to open and turn jammy, squish them so they turn saucy. At this point, add chili flakes and continue to cook until broken down into a sauce. Make your toast. While your tomatoes cook, either toast or grill your bread. To grill, heat a good glug olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add bread and grill until golden on both sides and sprinkle with salt. Once bread is toasted or grilled, take a peeled garlic clove and rub it across the bread. Finish your shakshuka. Once tomatoes are cooked, add dollops of cottage cheese throughout your pan. Make little pockets in your tomatoes with a spoon and crack eggs in, cover and cook for 3-6 minutes (4 for soft yolk, 6 for hard). Remove from heat, remove lid and sprinkle with EBTB seasoning or sesame seeds, salt, and fresh herbs. Serve with toast.",

Add the pasta to the zucchinis, grate in the lemon zest, then add the mascarpone and a generous splash of the reserved pasta water.
